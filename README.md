## Data

The video I used in this tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JbwLyqpFCXmftaJY1oap8Sa6KfjoWJta/view?usp=sharing).

## Model

A Yolov8 pre-trained model (YOLOv8n) was used to detect vehicles.

A licensed plate detector was used to detect license plates. The model was trained with Yolov8 using [this dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/dataset/4). 
- The model is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zmf5ynaTFhmln2z7Qvv-tgjkWQYQ9Zdw/view?usp=sharing).

## Dependencies

The sort module needs to be downloaded from [this repository](https://github.com/abewley/sort).

## Project Setup
Make an environment with python=3.8 using the following
